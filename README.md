# "FREEZE" CHROME EXTENSION
### By Madeline Archibald 

Created for NMED 3720 at the University of Lethbridge, this project was inspired by the recent polar vortex that made its way through southern Alberta in February of 2021. Generally, our computing devices have a habit of overheating, and rather than bringing them into the frigid outdoors, what if they could experience similar levels of cold through aesthetics? With this Chrome Extension, the user can modify the DOM of almost any webpage to look like their browser is also experiencing a polar vortex without any fear of their device actually freezing up! 

The DOM modifications are activated via communication between a popup and the webpage’s console using jQuery and JavaScript. The extension’s popup offers a series of negative temperature degrees that double as they become colder and create a hierarchy of aesthetics for the user to experience, ultimately creating a blizzard-like compilation of frozen additions to the user’s webpage. The use of cool color palettes and simple graphics enable the user to experience the illusion of an extreme “polarization” to a cold environment on their webpage. 

Disclaimer: aesthetics do not affect the interior temperature of the user’s device and is not responsible for overheating or freezing. Side effects may include bundling up to stay warm in the frigid illusion provided on screen. Do not attempt to reheat the device.
